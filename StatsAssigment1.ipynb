    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p>Nominal level of measurement: This level of measurement is used to classify data into categories that do not have any order or rank. The categories are simply used to label or identify items. Examples of variables at the nominal level of measurement include gender (male, female), eye color (brown, blue, green), and race (Caucasian, African American, Asian).</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p>Ordinal level of measurement: This level of measurement allows variables to be ranked or ordered based on some criterion or characteristic. However, the differences between the categories are not necessarily equal or measurable. Examples of variables at the ordinal level of measurement include education level (high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree), socioeconomic status (low, middle, high), and grade in a course (A, B, C, D, F).</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p>Interval level of measurement: This level of measurement is similar to the ordinal level, but the differences between the categories are equal and measurable.

Examples of variables at the interval level of measurement include temperature (Fahrenheit or Celsius), IQ scores, and dates (measured in years or days from a certain point).</p>\n",

    "<p>Ratio level of measurement: This level of measurement is the most precise and has a true zero point.

Different levels of measurement have different properties, which affect the way data can be analyzed and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have data on the favorite color of a group of people, we need to know the level of measurement of the variable to perform appropriate analysis. If the variable is measured on a nominal scale, we can only count the number of people who choose each color and calculate the percentage of people for each color. We cannot compute a mean or variance because nominal data have no natural ordering or hierarchy. On the other hand, if the variable is measured on an ordinal scale, we can rank the colors from most to least popular and compute the median or mode. However, we cannot assume that the intervals between ranks are equal, and we cannot compute a meaningful mean or variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if the variable is measured on an interval or ratio scale, we can assume equal intervals between values and compute a meaningful mean and variance.

For instance, we can randomly select a sample of 100 students, calculate their average height, and use inferential statistics to make predictions about the average height of all students in the school.\n",
